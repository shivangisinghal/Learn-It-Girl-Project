# Learn-It-Girl-Project
[Learn It, Girl](https://www.learnitgirl.com/) is a mentorship program for women around the globe. It's aim is to help women learn a new programming language by providing a mentor. My mentor is [Shrreya Bhatachaarya](https://github.com/Shrreya). 
This is a Python based web gaming project which I've made under this program using django framework.
